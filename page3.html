                    If you are keen to help us on this mission, a donation is a great way. It will help pay for the science required to understand the issues, the education necessary to get support for marine protection, and the negotiation vital to getting legislation.

                    Our main focus, at present, is to save coral reefs. We need to buy them enough time to adapt to climate change by identifying the areas that can be saved and then ensuring we do just that - protecting them from the local pressures (such as pollution and overfishing). Time is definitely against us.
